	<h1>Why i want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a developer because I’m deeply 
		passionate about technology and problem-solving. 
		From a young age, I’ve been passionate by how 
		software powers the world around us, 
		and I’ve always been curious about how things 
		work behind the scenes.
