	<h1>Why i want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a developer because I’m deeply passionate about technology and problem-solving. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how software powers the world around us, and I’ve always been curious about how things work behind the scenes. Coding allows me to turn that curiosity into creativity - building things that are useful, impactful, and meaningful.
